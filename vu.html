        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Globalization and automation are transformative forces reshaping economies, labor markets, and societies worldwide. This paper explores my individual contributions to a partnered project examining the interplay between globalization and automation, focusing on their ethical implications, societal impacts, and relevance in today’s world. My research centered on automation’s role in global labor markets, complementing my partner’s focus on globalization’s cultural and economic dimensions. This paper addresses the project’s learning objectives by detailing my contributions, background research, ethical analysis, correctness and relevance of the work, and broader impacts with future work considerations.</p>

      <section class="paper-section">
        <h2>Individual Contributions</h2>
        <p>My contribution to the partnered project focused on automation’s impact on global labor markets, particularly how technological advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) are reshaping employment patterns across developed and developing economies. I conducted primary research by reviewing scholarly articles, industry reports, and economic data to understand automation’s effects on job displacement and creation. My work informed the project artifact—a multimedia presentation that included data visualizations of automation trends, such as the adoption of industrial robots (International Federation of Robotics, 2024) and AI-driven job shifts (Frey & Osborne, 2017).</p>
        <p>I designed interactive charts to illustrate automation’s uneven impact across industries and regions, highlighting how low-skill jobs in manufacturing are more vulnerable in developing nations, while high-skill jobs in tech sectors are growing in developed economies. This complemented my partner’s exploration of globalization’s role in facilitating technology transfer and cultural exchange, as my findings showed how global supply chains amplify automation’s reach. Together, our work presented a cohesive narrative on how globalization accelerates automation’s adoption, reshaping economies and societies.</p>

        <h2>Background Research and Review</h2>
        <p>The background research for my contribution involved a comprehensive review of academic and industry sources. Key studies included Frey and Osborne’s (2017) analysis, which estimated that 47% of jobs in the U.S. are at risk of automation, and Autor et al. (2020), who explored how automation exacerbates income inequality by polarizing labor markets. I also reviewed reports from the World Bank (2023) and McKinsey Global Institute (2024), which provided data on automation’s global diffusion through multinational corporations and its impact on emerging economies.</p>
        <p>To contextualize automation within globalization, I examined how global supply chains enable the rapid deployment of automation technologies. For instance, multinational firms leverage globalization to standardize production processes, integrating robotics in factories across multiple countries (Baldwin, 2019). My research also highlighted regional disparities, such as Asia’s rapid automation adoption (e.g., China’s robot density surpassing Germany’s in 2023) compared to slower uptake in Africa due to infrastructure constraints (International Federation of Robotics, 2024). This research informed the project artifact by grounding our presentation in empirical data and scholarly insights. It also shaped my ethical analysis by revealing automation’s potential to widen global inequalities.</p>

        <h2>Ethical Framework and Analysis</h2>
        <h3>Utilitarian Analysis</h3>
        <p>Utilitarianism evaluates actions based on their consequences for overall happiness or well-being. Automation offers significant benefits, such as increased productivity and reduced production costs, which can lower consumer prices and improve living standards globally (Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2014). However, it also causes job displacement, particularly for low-skill workers in developing nations, leading to unemployment and social unrest (World Bank, 2023). My analysis weighed these trade-offs, concluding that automation’s net utility depends on policies like reskilling programs to mitigate harm. This perspective informed our project’s emphasis on advocating for workforce retraining in the presentation.</p>
        <h3>Justice as Fairness (Rawlsian Analysis)</h3>
        <p>John Rawls’ justice as fairness framework prioritizes equitable distribution of benefits and burdens, emphasizing the needs of the least advantaged. Automation often concentrates economic gains among high-skill workers and corporations in developed nations, exacerbating global inequalities (Autor et al., 2020). For example, workers in developing countries face disproportionate job losses due to automation in manufacturing, with limited access to retraining or alternative employment (World Bank, 2023). This framework highlighted the need for policies ensuring fair access to automation’s benefits, such as global investment in education. Our project artifact incorporated this by proposing ethical guidelines for multinational corporations to support displaced workers.</p>
        <h3>Comparison of Frameworks</h3>
        <p>The utilitarian approach focuses on aggregate outcomes, potentially overlooking individual hardships, while justice as fairness prioritizes equity, demanding proactive measures to protect vulnerable populations. The justice framework proved more effective in addressing automation’s unequal impacts, as it directly informed our project’s call for equitable policy solutions. Both analyses shaped the artifact by emphasizing ethical considerations in automation’s global deployment.</p>

        <h2>Correctness and Relevance</h2>
        <h3>Correctness of Analysis</h3>
        <p>The correctness of my analysis is supported by robust scholarly evidence. Studies like Frey and Osborne (2017) and Autor et al. (2020) provide empirical data on automation’s labor market effects, while World Bank (2023) and McKinsey (2024) reports validate claims about global disparities. My data visualizations in the project artifact were cross-checked against raw datasets from the International Federation of Robotics (2024) to ensure accuracy. Peer reviews from my cohort further confirmed the clarity and validity of my contributions.</p>
        <h3>Comparison to Popular Media</h3>
        <p>Popular media often portrays automation as either a utopian solution or a dystopian threat. For example, outlets like BBC and CNN frequently highlight AI’s potential to revolutionize industries (e.g., autonomous vehicles) or eliminate jobs (e.g., factory automation) without nuanced discussion (BBC, 2025; CNN, 2025). In contrast, our scholarly argument, grounded in data, acknowledges both automation’s benefits and challenges, emphasizing the role of policy in shaping outcomes. Unlike media narratives that focus on sensationalism, our project provides a balanced view, advocating for reskilling and equitable technology distribution.</p>
        <h3>Relevance to Current State</h3>
        <p>The project’s relevance is evident in recent global trends. The World Economic Forum (2025) notes that automation is accelerating due to post-COVID economic recovery, with 85 million jobs at risk by 2030 but 97 million new roles emerging. This underscores the urgency of addressing automation’s impacts within globalization’s framework, making our project timely and impactful.</p>

        <h2>Impacts, Threats to Validity, and Future Work</h2>
        <h3>Broader Impacts</h3>
        <p>The project’s findings have implications for policymakers, corporations, and educators. By highlighting automation’s role in global labor markets, it informs policies for reskilling programs and equitable technology adoption. For example, multinational corporations could fund training initiatives in developing nations to mitigate job losses, as seen in pilot programs by companies like Siemens (McKinsey, 2024).</p>
        <h3>Threats to Validity</h3>
        <p>The project’s scope was limited by its focus on automation’s labor market effects, potentially overlooking cultural or environmental impacts. Data availability posed challenges, as some regions (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa) lack comprehensive automation statistics. The class project’s time constraints also restricted longitudinal analysis, which could reveal long-term trends.</p>
        <h3>Future Work</h3>
        <p>Future research could explore automation’s environmental impact or its intersection with other global trends, such as climate change. Expanding the ethical analysis to include virtue ethics or care ethics could provide additional perspectives. Pilot studies on reskilling programs in developing nations could also test the feasibility of our proposed solutions.</p>
